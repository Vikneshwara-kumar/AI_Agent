# Product Requirements Document: Slack-Integrated Data Analytics Platform

## Overview
This PRD outlines the requirements for developing an integrated data analytics platform that connects with Slack and our existing ticketing system. The platform aims to streamline data access and analysis for non-technical teams across various departments.

## Problem Statement
Currently, non-technical teams must manually transfer data between Slack conversations, ticketing systems, and analytics tools, leading to inefficiencies and potential data loss. Team members spend approximately 5 hours per week on manual data entry and coordination.

## Target Users
- Marketing teams tracking campaign performance
- Customer support teams analyzing ticket patterns
- Sales teams monitoring lead conversion metrics
- Finance teams tracking revenue-related conversations
- Product teams gathering user feedback

## Key Requirements

### Integration Features
1. Automatic data ingestion from Slack channels
   - Capture relevant messages and attachments
   - Parse structured data from conversations
   - Store metadata (timestamps, users, channels)

2. Ticketing System Connection
   - Bi-directional sync with existing ticketing system
   - Automatic ticket creation from Slack conversations
   - Real-time status updates in both systems

### Analytics Capabilities
1. Data Visualization
   - Customizable dashboards
   - Pre-built report templates
   - Export capabilities to common formats

2. Machine Learning Features
   - Sentiment analysis of customer interactions
   - Automatic categorization of conversations
   - Trend detection and anomaly alerts

### User Experience
1. Interface Requirements
   - No-code dashboard builder
   - Drag-and-drop report creation
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Dark/light mode support

2. Access Control
   - Role-based permissions
   - Department-level data segregation
   - Audit logging

## Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in manual data entry time
- 90% user adoption within 3 months
- 95% data accuracy in automated transfers
- Customer satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- ROI positive within 6 months

## Technical Constraints
- Must comply with SOC 2 requirements
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Max 500ms response time for queries
- Support for up to 10,000 concurrent users

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (Q1): Basic integration and data collection
- Phase 2 (Q2): Analytics and visualization features
- Phase 3 (Q3): Machine learning capabilities
- Phase 4 (Q4): Advanced features and optimization

## Budget
- Development: $400,000
- Infrastructure: $75,000/year
- Training and support: $50,000
- Maintenance: $100,000/year

## Risks and Mitigation
- Data privacy concerns: Implement end-to-end encryption
- User adoption: Provide comprehensive training
- System performance: Regular load testing and optimization
- Integration stability: Redundant failover systems

## Next Steps
1. Technical architecture review
2. Security assessment
3. UI/UX prototyping
4. Stakeholder sign-off
5. Development team allocation
